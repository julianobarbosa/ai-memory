//! `ai-memory doctor` — capture-coverage check.
//!
//! Capture is silently gated on each harness having an ai-memory hook
//! installed: a harness with no hook still writes its own local session
//! transcripts, but nothing reaches the server, and nothing today reconciles
//! "this harness ran in this project" against "this harness captured nothing".
//! An operator who believes all their harnesses feed one memory is then
//! quietly wrong (audit finding F1 — Kimi ran on a project for weeks with no
//! hook and zero captured sessions).
//!
//! This command makes that gap visible. For the current project it enumerates
//! the local native session stores of every known harness (reusing the
//! read-only workstream adapters, so the per-harness path encoding lives in
//! exactly one place), asks the server how many sessions it captured per agent
//! (`GET /admin/sessions/by-agent`), and warns when a harness has recent local
//! sessions here but zero captured ones — with the exact `install-hooks`
//! command to close the gap.
//!
//! It never opens the store directly; the server remains the source of truth
//! for the captured side, and the local side is read-only.
