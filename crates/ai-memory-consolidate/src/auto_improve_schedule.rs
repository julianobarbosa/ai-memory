//! Scheduled auto-improvement orchestration.
//!
//! The server-side scheduler (started by `ai-memory serve`) drives one
//! non-overlapping tick per configured interval; this module owns what a
//! tick *does*: seed per-scope watermarks at startup, claim newly
//! completed sessions (at-most-once per session), run
//! [`run_auto_improve_review`], stage the validated proposals, write the
//! human-reviewable sidecars, and auto-approve them through the wiki
//! mutation path unless the operator requires manual approval.
//!
//! Approval-gate semantics are deliberately identical to the manual
//! CLI/admin/MCP path: proposals are always staged first, and
//! `require_approval` only decides whether they are applied immediately
//! or left pending — see `docs/auto-improvement-loop.md`.
