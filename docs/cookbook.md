## What ai-memory is, in one paragraph

ai-memory gives your AI coding agents long-term, cross-session memory. It runs
as one server; your agent talks to it over MCP (tools like `memory_query`,
`memory_write_page`) and over lifecycle hooks that automatically capture what you
do. Memory is a **markdown wiki in git** (the source of truth, hand-editable) plus
a derived SQLite index for search. Everything is **scoped per project**
`(workspace, project)`, resolved from markers/home routes or, by default, the
normalized repository path (`upstream`, then `origin`; folder basename only
without a valid remote). It works with no LLM at all (capture + full-text search + rule-based summaries); adding a provider
enables consolidation and auto-improvement.

## Recipe: use ai-memory as your tool's memory

Call the existing MCP tools to save pages, query knowledge and pass a handoff
between executions. Native hooks are optional. The [programmatic memory guide](programmatic-memory.md)
includes complete HTTP requests, scope rules and machine authentication.
If your tool also hosts a harness, follow the [external lifecycle contract](external-lifecycle.md).

## Everyday tasks (through your agent, over MCP)

You mostly just talk to your agent; it calls the right tool. Common ones:

| You want | Say to your agent | Tool it uses |
|---|---|---|
| Recall prior work | "Have we discussed X?" / "what did we decide about Y?" | `memory_query` |
| Catch up after time away | "Where did we leave off?" / "catch me up" | handoff block / `memory_explore` |
| Remember a durable fact | "Remember that we always use pnpm here" | `memory_write_page` |
| Remember until a date | "Remember this until the migration ships" | `memory_write_page` + `expires_at` |
| A standing rule for *every* project | "Always: never force-push" | `memory_write_page` with `scope: "global"` |
| Read a specific saved page in full | "Read the `_rules/deploy` page" | `memory_read_page` |
| Save context for the next session | "Wrap up — save context for next time" | `memory_handoff_begin` |
| See project stats | "How much memory do we have?" | `memory_status` / `memory_briefing` |

You rarely write pages by hand: lifecycle hooks capture prompts and tool calls
automatically, and (with an LLM) consolidation compiles them into pages.

## Recipe: keep a rule a project must follow

> "Remember: before touching the payment code, read the PCI notes."

Your agent calls `memory_write_page` and it lands as a durable wiki page (routed
under `_rules/` when it's a rule). Next session, `memory_query` surfaces it, and
if the project's `.ai-memory.toml` opts into the on-start brief, rules are
prepended to the agent's context automatically. To make it apply to **all** your
projects, ask for it as a standing preference — it goes to your cross-project
profile (see the next recipe), or to the shared `_global` scope with
`scope: "global"`. On a multi-user
server, writing a global rule needs root or a `write` grant on `_global`. From
another project's page, link to that standing page with `[[_global:path]]` — it
always names the reserved `_global` project in the default workspace. Sibling
projects use `[[project:path]]`; another workspace uses
`[[workspace/project:path]]`. Bare `[[name]]` stays inside the current project.

## Recipe: stop re-explaining your habits in every new project

> "In all my projects: use pnpm, keep integration tests in tests/suite."

Your agent writes each one into the cross-project profile
(`memory_write_page` with `scope: "profile"`). From then on every project — and
every harness — gets a short "your usual choices" section at session start, and
the agent applies those choices whenever the repository's rules file and you
say nothing. A brand-new repository gets the whole baseline, plus a pointer to
`ai-memory profile apply` for writing it into that repository's rules file.

- You don't have to ask: habits you state in your prompts ("always…", "prefer
  X over Y", "from now on…") are learned on their own once you say them as a
  general rule or in two projects. `ai-memory profile review` shows what was
  learned, from which words, and what is still one project short.
- See what it holds: `ai-memory profile list`; drop one: `ai-memory profile
  forget tools/pnpm.md` (it stays dropped until you say it again).
- Keep a client project out of it: `[profile] contribute = false` in that
  repository's `.ai-memory.toml`; keep the digest out of one: `consume = false`.
- Scope an entry to a stack with frontmatter `applies_to: [rust]`.
- On by default for a single user (one profile across every workspace). On a
  shared server it is off until the operator sets `[profile] enabled = true`,
  and then each person gets a private profile.

Details: [`cross-project-profile.md`](cross-project-profile.md).

## Recipe: have a project read a specific document before implementing

Two ways, depending on where the document lives:

1. **It's already a wiki page** (you saved it, or imported it — below): tell the
   agent "read the `norms/gdpr-retention` page before implementing" — it calls
   `memory_read_page` with that path and works from the full body.
2. **It's an external file** (a norm/spec on disk): save it as a page first
   ("remember this spec as `norms/gdpr-retention`", paste or point at it), then
   reference it as in (1). Large references are best split into a page per
   document so retrieval can pull just the relevant one.

## Recipe: import an existing knowledge base (e.g. OKF norms/laws/specs)

ai-memory's wiki **is** OKF (Obsidian-compatible markdown + frontmatter). To
bring an existing body of documents in as project memory:

- **A few documents**: save each as a durable page via your agent
  (`memory_write_page`) or the CLI (`ai-memory write-page`), one page per
  document, under a stable prefix like `norms/…`. Then any project can read a
  specific one before implementing (recipe above).
- **A whole OKF/Obsidian vault or an export from another tool**: use the
  companion importer (see [`companion-crates.md`](companion-crates.md)) — it
  ingests OMC and external-conversation exports into the store. `ai-memory
  export-okf` is the inverse (export your wiki as an OKF bundle), useful to see
  the exact on-disk shape your documents should take.
- The wiki lives at `<data_dir>/wiki/<workspace>/<project>/…` and is plain
  markdown in git, so you can also drop files in and let the file watcher +
  reindex pick them up. Keep them under a clear prefix and commit.

Once the material is saved as pages in the right scope, any project can search
it (`memory_query`) and read a specific document in full (`memory_read_page`)
before implementing against it.

## Recipe: mirror a team wiki into the repository (team wiki sync)

To keep a team's shared memory reviewable next to the code it documents, use
the [`ai-memory-wikisync`](../companions/ai-memory-wikisync) companion
(boundary in [`companion-crates.md`](companion-crates.md)). It exports
explicitly allowlisted page families from the server's read-only `/api/v1`
surface into a directory in your repo — dry-run by default:

```bash
ai-memory-wikisync plan   --server http://127.0.0.1:49374 \
    --workspace demo --project app --dest ./wiki \
    --include _rules --include decisions     # lists create/update/unchanged; never writes
ai-memory-wikisync export ...same args... --apply   # writes; prints the git commands to run
```

Everything is opt-in and fail-safe: the family allowlist must be explicit
(`*` is refused), files edited locally since the last export are reported
with a diff summary and refused without `--force`, nothing is ever deleted
(that is a later slice), no frontmatter is forged, and the tool never runs
git itself. Slice 1 is read-only export; bidirectional sync, deletes and
conflict handling are tracked in #986.

## Recipe: control what gets kept, aged, or consolidated

By default nothing you have to think about: memory decays on a single gentle
curve, and an upgrade to 2.4 changes no scores and evicts nothing. When you *do*
want to tune aging, it is all opt-in and reversible — the original of anything
compacted or merged stays in git and the supersession chain, recoverable with
`ai-memory restore-page`.

- **Keep something forever:** pin it. A pinned page is exempt from the
  forget-sweep regardless of tier or age. Semantic and procedural pages never
  decay either — only working/episodic memory ages.
- **Make a note expire on a deadline:** ask your agent to remember it "until
  <date>" (an `expires_at`); the forget-sweep deletes it when the time passes,
  no matter how often it was read. A TTL outranks pinning.
- **Tune how long each tier lasts:** set per-tier half-lives in the project's
  `.ai-memory.toml` `[decay.half_life_days]` (e.g. keep episodic history longer,
  working-tier scratch shorter). Omit it for the default single curve.
- **Compact instead of evict, and de-duplicate:** `[decay] compact_cold_episodic`
  keeps a cold page's durable facts (paths, error codes, decisions) and drops the
  prose; `[decay] dedup_cold_clusters` collapses near-duplicate cold pages into
  one survivor. Both are zero-LLM, off by default, and supersede rather than
  delete.
- **Keep used memory longer:** nothing to configure — a page you open, search,
  or reach through a related-pages walk is reinforced automatically and resists
  decay.
- **Surface likely contradictions:** run `memory_lint` (through your agent or the
  CLI); with embeddings configured it flags pairs of same-topic pages that look
  like they conflict, advisory only. Similarity reads shared vocabulary as much
  as disagreement, so a single-domain or single-language store yields mostly
  candidate pairs: read each finding as a pair to check, not as a defect. If
  that noise is too high, raise `contradiction_band_min` (`config.toml` or
  `AI_MEMORY_CONTRADICTION_BAND_MIN`, default `0.4`) — on such a store the
  band measures domain proximity more than conflict, so a higher floor trims
  same-domain-but-unrelated pairs.
- **Let an LLM consolidate on idle ("dream"):** with a provider *and* an embedder
  configured, `[dream] enabled` turns on a background pass that rewrites clusters
  of cold notes into single coherent pages while you're idle and cancels the
  moment you return. It is off by default, never deletes a source, and is gated on
  an internal recall eval before it could ever become default behavior.

## Recipe: two agents / two repos working together

- **Continuity across agents in the same project** (quit Claude Code, open Codex
  in the same repo): automatic. A handoff is captured at session end and the
  next session's on-start hook prepends it. Ask "where did we leave off?".
- **Ask an agent in another project to do something** without loading that
  project's context here: cross-project messaging — "send project-b a request to
  add the export endpoint" (`memory_message_send`), and over there "check my
  inbox" (`memory_message_pop`). See [`agent-messaging.md`](agent-messaging.md).

## Recipe: several accounts or an external launcher

Give each account or provider its own config home and pass it with `--env`, so
the harness, its hooks and MCP, and transcript import all use that one home:

```bash
ai-memory run --env CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR="$HOME/.claude-work" claude
ai-memory run --env CODEX_HOME="$HOME/.codex-work" codex   # the dir must exist
```

- `--env` and `--env-file` belong to `ai-memory run`, so they go before the
  harness name.
- A launcher or orchestrator that starts harnesses with its own environment
  (provider keys, an account's config dir) can write it to a file and pass
  `--env-file <path>`, one `KEY=VALUE` per line. Values are taken literally, so
  use absolute paths in the file.
- To name an account once instead of repeating `--env`, add a profile to
  `config.toml` and select it with `--profile` (before the harness name):

  ```toml
  [run.profiles.work.env]
  CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR = "/home/me/.claude-work"
  ```

  Then `ai-memory run --profile work claude`. Use absolute paths: profile
  values are not expanded. `--env-file` and `--env` still override a profile
  entry, and an unknown name fails before anything is wired or launched. A
  `--profile` after the harness name belongs to the harness (OMP and Codex
  have their own).
- Auto-wire runs once per config home, so the second account gets its hooks +
  MCP on its own first launch. To wire one by hand, export the variable for the
  installers: `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR="$HOME/.claude-work" ai-memory install-hooks
  --agent claude-code --apply`, then the same for `install-mcp --client
  claude-code --apply`.

See [`managed-workstreams.md`](managed-workstreams.md).

## Recipe: run an unsupervised agent safely (`--yolo` + ai-jail)

`--yolo` maps to each harness's dangerous-mode flag (Claude Code →
`--dangerously-skip-permissions`), which runs every tool call with no
confirmation. `ai-memory run --yolo` adds guardrails around that, gated
entirely on a real interactive terminal (stdin and stderr both TTYs), so
scripts, hooks, and CI are never prompted:

```bash
ai-memory run --yolo claude
```

- **The warning.** Before the agent spawns, you are asked to confirm:
  `Enter`/`y`/`yes` proceeds (the default); `n`/`no` aborts before anything
  launches.
- **The ai-jail offer.** If [ai-jail](https://github.com/akitaonrails/ai-jail)
  is usable — on Linux/macOS, installed on `PATH` (or `~/.local/bin/ai-jail`),
  with its sandbox backend present (`bwrap` on Linux, `sandbox-exec` on
  macOS) — and you are not already inside it, a second question offers to
  re-run the session inside it. When it is not usable (or on Windows) there is
  no second question; the run just proceeds. Accepting re-execs the original
  command under `ai-jail --network --agent-state --env <NAME>... --`,
  forwarding only the credential/config
  environment variables that are already set (server/hook URL,
  `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, provider API keys, etc.) — `--network` keeps the
  loopback ai-memory server reachable while still sandboxing the filesystem.
  Declining keeps the run unsandboxed (your choice, already warned).
- **Choosing what the jail gets.** After you accept the offer, a checklist
  lists what this host can mount, pre-marked so `Enter` does the friendly
  thing: every credential that exists (`~/.config/gh`, `~/.aws`, `~/.kube`,
  `~/.config/gcloud`, `~/.docker/config.json`), SSH keys + agent when your
  `origin` is an SSH remote, and worktree metadata in a linked worktree. The
  Docker socket (grants host root), GPU, display, Pictures, and Tailscale are
  listed unchecked. Type row numbers to flip them (`2 4`), or `all` / `none`.
  A mounted credential is usable by the unsupervised agent, so uncheck what it
  should not touch. What you see is what you get: unchecked rows are passed
  as `--no-X`, so they stay off even if your global `~/.ai-jail` enables them.
- **Skipping the questions.** `ai-memory run --jail claude` re-runs inside
  ai-jail straight away, turning on those pre-marked defaults and leaving
  everything else to your own ai-jail config — with or without `--yolo`, and
  in scripts too; it fails rather than running unjailed if ai-jail is not
  usable. `--jail=github,ssh,no-mise` is exact: the listed toggles (`no-X`
  forces one off), with every other checklist row forced off; `all` turns
  every row on and `none` turns every row off. `--no-jail` never jails and skips the
  offer (the `--yolo` warning stays). There are no bare `--github`-style
  flags on purpose: they would collide with the harness's own flags (Claude
  Code has a `--worktree`). The credential mounts need ai-jail 2.5.0; toggles
  your installed ai-jail lacks are hidden, and naming one is an error.
- **A project `.ai-jail` wins.** If the directory you launch from has its own
  `.ai-jail`, ai-jail loads it as-is: no checklist, and a bare `--jail` adds
  no toggles; `--jail=…` still applies its list on top. A project file cannot
  enable credentials (ai-jail treats it as untrusted), so to have them mounted
  automatically there, enable them in your global `~/.ai-jail` or pass
  `--jail=github,…`. ai-memory always passes `--no-save-config`, so a jailed
  run never writes its own flags into your repository's `.ai-jail`.
- **Already inside ai-jail.** Both prompts are skipped and the run proceeds
  directly — `ai-jail ai-memory run … --yolo` sees no extra friction.
  Detection is Linux (`ai-sandbox` hostname) / macOS (`PS1` starting with
  `(jail) `); it fails open (shows the warning) when undetectable, never
  open to skipping it silently.
- **Claude "true yolo".** `--true-yolo` includes everything `--yolo` does
  (`ai-memory run claude --true-yolo` is enough; adding `--yolo` too is
  harmless) and, for Claude, also forces `bypassPermissions` over any
  `defaultMode` in your settings. For other harnesses it is the same as
  `--yolo`. `claude_true_yolo = true` in `config.toml` /
  `AI_MEMORY_CLAUDE_TRUE_YOLO=true` applies the Claude extra to every `--yolo`
  launch, never to a run without it.
  **It cannot remove your own `ask` rules**: Claude Code honors explicit
  `permissions.ask` rules (and its built-in command-safety checks) in every
  mode, so a rule like `Bash(docker run *)` in `~/.claude/settings.json` still
  pauses the run. For a pause-free sandbox, drop those `ask` entries — `deny`
  rules block without pausing, so they can stay. Best paired with ai-jail.
- **Passing extra env, e.g. a GitHub token.** `ai-memory run claude --yolo
  --env GH_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)"` forwards it into the jailed agent (needs
  ai-jail 2.4.2 or later when you accept the jail offer). This
  hands a sandboxed agent your token, so only do it for work you'd trust it
  with; it is deliberately never forwarded automatically.

See [`design-yolo-safety-ai-jail.md`](design-yolo-safety-ai-jail.md) for the
full contract.

## Recipe: capture only some repositories

`install-hooks --agent claude-code --apply` wires the hooks user-wide
(`~/.claude/settings.json`), so every Claude Code session is captured and you
exclude paths with `[capture] ignore_paths` in `.ai-memory.toml`. To opt in
per repository instead, run from inside the checkout:

```bash
ai-memory install-hooks --agent claude-code --scope project --apply
```

This writes the repository's gitignored `.claude/settings.local.json` where
Claude Code reads it (the git root; the current directory on Windows or when
the repository root is your home directory) and leaves the user-level file
alone. Backups of an updated file go under the data dir, not the checkout.
Pick one scope per machine: Claude Code merges project and user hooks. The
installer warns when the file is not git-ignored, and `ai-memory uninstall
--only hooks --apply` from inside the checkout removes the entries again.
Claude Code only; other harnesses keep their user-level hook files.

## Recipe: send different repositories to different servers

One machine, several organisations, each with its own ai-memory server.
Register each server once under a name, with the directory it is allowed to
serve, then let each repository's marker pick it:

```bash
ai-memory server add team-a --url https://memory-a.example.com --root ~/work/team-a --auth-token-stdin
ai-memory server add team-b --url https://memory-b.example.com --root ~/work/team-b --auth-token-stdin
```

```toml
# ~/work/team-b/.ai-memory.toml
workspace = "team-b"
server = "team-b"
```

Repositories without a `server` key keep using the server `install-hooks`
configured. The marker only ever names a profile; a profile that does not
resolve drops the event rather than sending it anywhere else. Details, the
fail-closed rules, and which integrations support it:
[`marker-file.md`](marker-file.md#routing-capture-to-another-server-server).

## Recipe: run the server on a Mac

Use the menu bar app when you want one `.app` that starts the server and
opens the existing tools (web UI, `ai-memory status`, config, logs). It does
not replace those tools with a second dashboard.

```bash
./companions/ai-memory-macos/build.sh
open "companions/ai-memory-macos/dist/AI Memory.app"
```

Drag **AI Memory.app** to `/Applications`, then **Install & Start Server**
from the menu extra. Wire an agent with the bundled binary:

```bash
BIN="/Applications/AI Memory.app/Contents/Resources/runtime/ai-memory"
"$BIN" install-mcp --client claude-code --apply
"$BIN" install-hooks --agent claude-code --apply
```

Memory stays in `~/Library/Application Support/ai-memory`. Replacing the
`.app` does not rewrite it. Full paths (tarball, source, Docker, launchd):
[`macos.md`](macos.md).

## From the terminal (CLI)

Your agent runs most of these for you; `run` and `continue` are how you start it:

```bash
ai-memory run <harness>              # launch a harness, hooks + MCP auto-wired
ai-memory continue                   # resume the newest managed checkout
ai-memory resume --search auth       # pick a matching workstream in this checkout only
ai-memory resume --all               # pick from every linked checkout on this machine
ai-memory workstreams                # list this checkout's managed workstreams
ai-memory status                     # counts, paths, health
ai-memory list-projects              # every workspace/project the server knows about
ai-memory doctor                     # is every harness that ran here captured?
ai-memory backfill                   # import prior local history into an empty store
ai-memory write-page …               # save a durable page
ai-memory handoffs                   # list open handoffs for the project
ai-memory message list               # cross-project inbox
ai-memory server list                # server profiles a marker can route to
ai-memory export-okf …               # export the wiki as an OKF bundle
ai-memory serve                      # run the server
```

## When it isn't doing what you expect

- **Server/homelab down**: `ai-memory run` does not need the server to start a
  harness. When the server is unreachable it prints one loud warning and
  launches anyway — hooks keep capturing to the local spool (drained
  automatically when the server returns), an existing MCP registration
  degrades to no-recall for the session, and the child's exit code is
  returned. What you lose for that run is the workstream lease/context,
  transcript import, and handoff delivery; sessions resume only through an
  explicit native selector because no lease means no mutual exclusion. See
  [Degraded offline
  launches](managed-workstreams.md#degraded-offline-launches). To fail instead
  of degrading, pass `--require-server` (or set `run.require_server = true` /
  `AI_MEMORY_RUN_REQUIRE_SERVER=true`). For a planned outage, consider
  `AI_MEMORY_HOOK_SPOOL_MAX_ATTEMPTS=0` so spooled events are never dropped
  for retry-attempt count.

- **Nothing is being remembered**: hooks may not be installed. `ai-memory run
  <harness>` installs its hooks + MCP on the first launch per harness,
  ai-memory version and config home, and again after `ai-memory uninstall`. If that harness
  already launched through `run` and its hooks went missing another way
  (removed by hand, a failed first wire), install them by hand: `ai-memory
  install-hooks --agent <your-agent> --apply` and `ai-memory install-mcp
  --client <client> --apply`. Then check `ai-memory status` / `ai-memory doctor`.
- **The current checkout resolves to an unexpected project**: run `ai-memory
  doctor`. Its project-coordinate block shows the effective local marker,
  credential-stripped repository identity source/style, canonical and legacy
  candidate names, the server's exact/compatibility/missing/ambiguous result,
  and whether an authorized write can promote the existing name in place. The
  check is read-only: an unknown coordinate is reported, never created. If the
  server coordinate is ambiguous, a returned UUID/current name is only the
  preferred identity-backed candidate for context, not a unique resolution or
  rename permission. Local harness rows remain visible and their captured
  counts are shown as unavailable rather than zero.
- **Only *some* agents are being remembered**: run `ai-memory doctor`. It lists
  every harness that has local sessions in this project and whether the server
  captured them — so a harness you rotated in without installing its hook (a
  silent gap: it keeps its own local history while capturing nothing) shows up
  as a warning with the exact `install-hooks` command to fix it. For Claude
  Code it also reports the detected default auto-memory directory and whether
  the repository's capture exclusions cover it. A custom
  `autoMemoryDirectory` is not discoverable from Claude's session transcripts
  and is not reported. An `excluded` verdict applies only to native/generated
  hooks; shell and PowerShell compatibility hooks do not enforce capture-policy
  exclusions.
- **I just installed hooks in a project I've worked in for a while**: the first
  time you open the project after installing, ai-memory imports your existing
  local session history once (bounded, sanitized on the server, only into an
  empty store) so it isn't starting from nothing. It runs automatically in the
  background; you can trigger or preview it yourself with `ai-memory backfill`
  (`--dry-run` to see what it would import), or turn it off with
  `AI_MEMORY_BACKFILL_ON_START=false`.
- **A search misses something you saved**: confirm the scope — memory is
  per-project; a page saved in project A is not returned in project B unless it
  was written to the global scope or you query with an explicit scope.
- **You want an LLM feature (consolidation, digests)**: set a provider
  (`AI_MEMORY_LLM_PROVIDER=…`); without one, capture + search still work.
